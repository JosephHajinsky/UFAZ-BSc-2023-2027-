We will focuses on implementing methods to compute the entropy of a character string and designing Huffman coding, a widely used compression algorithm. Entropy measures the average information content of a message, while Huffman coding is an optimal prefix coding technique that minimizes the average number of bits required to represent characters in a string."

    "Entropy of a character string is a measure of the information content or uncertainty associated with the characters in the string. In information theory, it is calculated using Shannon's entropy formula, which considers the probabilities of individual characters occurring in the string. A higher entropy indicates greater unpredictability or randomness in the string, while lower entropy suggests a more ordered or predictable sequence of characters.\n",

    "Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that efficiently represents data by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies. Developed by David A. Huffman, it constructs a binary tree where shorter codes are assigned to more frequent characters. Huffman coding achieves compression by using shorter codes for common characters, reducing the overall number of bits needed to represent the data. This method is widely utilized in various compression applications, providing an effective way to encode and decode information with minimal loss.\n",
